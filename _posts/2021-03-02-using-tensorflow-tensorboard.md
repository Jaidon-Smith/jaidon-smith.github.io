When doing machine learning research, it is important to be able to have real time visualisation. TensorBoard allows such visualisation. This post will document my experiments utilising TensorBoard.

# TensorBoard Guides
I Looked at these guides:
* [TensorBoard Getting Started Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started)
* [TensorBoard Scalars: Logging training metrics in Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/scalars_and_keras)
* [Displaying image data in TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/image_summaries)
* [Examining the TensorBoard Graph](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/graphs)

These TensorFlow API references are also relevant
* [Writing to logs: tf.summary](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/summary?version=nightly)
* [Understannding callbacks in keras: tf.keras.callbacks](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks)
