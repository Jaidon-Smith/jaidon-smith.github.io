When doing machine learning with Google Colab I have been mounting my Google Drive and giving a folder from it as the data directory. This solution is not going to scale very well with large datasets or other places to run the code such as an AI Notebook so I am going to investigate using Google Cloud Storage.

I still want to integrate Google Drive into my workflow however because from what I have been able to see, Google Drive is more affordable for long term dataset storage as the price per month is comparable to nearline at $6.25 per TB and no data retrieval costs.
